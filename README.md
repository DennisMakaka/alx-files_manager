# 0x04. Files Manager

## Project Overview
The Files Manager project is a backend-focused application that implements file management functionality using modern web technologies. This project demonstrates proficiency in creating RESTful APIs, handling asynchronous operations, and integrating with databases like MongoDB and Redis.

The project features include file uploads, user authentication, and job processing using Kue. This project is a solid introduction to backend development with Node.js and related frameworks and libraries.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
- Gain experience with Node.js, Express.js, and ES6 features.
- Work with NoSQL databases like MongoDB for data storage.
- Understand how to use Redis for caching and ephemeral data storage.
- Learn how to manage background jobs with Kue.
- Explore best practices for designing RESTful APIs.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Modern JavaScript syntax for backend development.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for creating APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing file metadata and user information.
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store used for caching and queuing.
- **Kue**: A priority job queue backed by Redis for managing background jobs.
